    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
<section>
        <P>HTML is the language that is used widely to write web pages.
            It stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language. 
            Any link available on web pages is generally called Hypertext, and mark-up refers to a tag or pages structure such that listed documents in webpages could be seen in a structured format. 
            The intent to develop HTML was to understand the structure of any documents: heading, body, inner contents, or paragraphs. So, basically, HTML provides a structural format to display the contents of web pages. 
            It is very simple and easy to understand. In the early nineties, it was developed by Tim Berners-Lee and later went through many changes and moderation.</P>
        <p> When the html code is opened in the browser, it looks like as shown below:</p>
            <img class="html_img" src="img/htmlcode.png" />

<h3>Main Components of HTML</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It is already said that HTML is a markup language that can use multiple tags to format the content.
     All of the tags are enclosed within the angular braces &lt;tagname&gt;.
    Except for a few tags, most of the tags start with angular braces and closed with corresponding angular braces.</li>
    <li>&lt;!DocType Html&gt; defines the document type and version of the Html. 
    Html code start just after &lt;html&gt; angular tag and ends with &lt;/html&gt; which could be seen from above screenshot.</li>
    <li>It generally has 2 major sections, which are head and body. 
    Each section has its own pertained elements and requirements.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>Disadvantages are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Html is used to create only plain or static pages. If one wants dynamic pages, then HTML is not useful. So, Html cannot use for dynamic output.</li>
    <li>Sometimes, the structuring of HTML is very difficult to grasp.</li>
    <li>Multiple lines of code are required to make a simple website.</li>
    <li>If one needs to write multiple code lines for simpler things, it increases the complexity and takes more time.</li>
    <li>Its error is costly because one small typo error could lead to the non-functioning of web pages.</li>
    <li>Html can be used for the first authentication step on the web, but it's not robust. So, Security features are not good in Html, and it provides only limited security.</li>
    <li>To better present web pages along with Html, other languages like CSS need to be learned.</li>
