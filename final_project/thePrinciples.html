                    <li>Increase Usability: </li>
                    <p>Following these visual-design principles often 
                    results in layouts that are easy to use For example, 
                    the golden ratio, which is frequently used for 
                    creating beautiful works of art was also used in 
                    typesetting to create a visually pleasing relationship 
                    between font size, line height, and line width.
                    </p>
                    <li>Provoke emotions and delight</li>
                    <p>Beautiful things elicit positive emotions.
                    In fact, the aesthetic, usability effect says 
                    that when people find a design visually appealing, 
                    they may be more forgiving of minor usability mishaps.
                    By following  the principles of good visual designs, 
                    designers can create UIs that look good and thus make 
                    users feel good</p>

                    <p>A strong visual system builds user trust and 
                    interest in the product and appropriately represents 
                    and reinforces the brand.
