            My name is Liam and I was born the 14th of October 2003. I was born and raised in Málaga, a city in the south of Spain in 
            the region of Andalucía, and have lived there my whole life until I moved to Dublin September 22nd 2022 to start this Computing 
            course. Before this I have touched a little bit of:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript</li>
        </ul>

        <p>At some point I would like to learn:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            But not limit myself to these because I would like to progress my career as a Software Developer.
            I don't know what I would like to work as as long as I get to code things because I enjoy it.
